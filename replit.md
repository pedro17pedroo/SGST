# Stock and Tracking Management System (SGST)

## Overview

SGST (Sistema de GestÃ£o de Stock e Rastreamento) is a world-class inventory management and logistics tracking system specifically designed for Angola's challenging infrastructure conditions. The system provides offline-first operation, computer vision automation, real-time location tracking, and comprehensive logistics management. It's built as a full-stack web application with a modern React frontend and Express.js backend, targeting Portuguese-speaking markets with AOA currency support.

The system handles complete inventory workflows including product registration, stock movements, order management, shipping tracking, fleet management, vehicle GPS tracking, automated counting, damage detection, real-time asset tracking, and comprehensive reporting with offline synchronization. It includes advanced fleet management capabilities with real-time GPS monitoring, vehicle-shipment associations, and mandatory GPS activation for drivers and operators. It's designed to operate reliably in low-connectivity environments while providing enterprise-grade capabilities for businesses of all sizes in Angola.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client application uses **React 18** with **TypeScript** and **Vite** for development tooling. The UI is built with **shadcn/ui components** and **Radix UI primitives**, providing a consistent design system with **Tailwind CSS** for styling. State management is handled through **TanStack Query** for server state and React hooks for local state.

The application follows a modular page-based routing structure using **Wouter** for client-side navigation. Key architectural decisions include:
- Component composition pattern with reusable UI components
- Hook-based data fetching with React Query for caching and synchronization
- Responsive design targeting both desktop and mobile devices
- Portuguese language support with currency formatting (AOA - Angolan Kwanza)

### Backend Architecture
The server is built with **Express.js** and **TypeScript**, following a modular architecture pattern with 25+ specialized modules. Key components include:
- **Routes layer**: RESTful API endpoints for all business operations
- **Storage layer**: Data access abstraction with comprehensive CRUD operations
- **Database layer**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Module system**: Pluggable architecture with dependency management

The API provides endpoints for:
- Dashboard analytics (stats, top products, recent activities)
- Product management (CRUD operations with search capabilities)
- Inventory tracking (stock levels, movements, alerts)
- Order processing and shipment management
- **Fleet management** (vehicle CRUD, GPS tracking, driver assignments)
- **Real-time GPS tracking** (vehicle locations, route optimization, geofencing)
- **Vehicle-shipment association** (assign vehicles to orders and shipments)
- User management and reporting
- **Offline synchronization** (CRDTs, conflict resolution)
- **Computer vision** (automated counting, damage detection, label reading)
- **Real-time location tracking** (RFID + UWB + BLE hybrid system)
- **Advanced analytics** and predictive insights

### Database Design
Uses **PostgreSQL** as the primary database with **Drizzle ORM** for schema management and queries. The schema includes:
- **Users**: Authentication and role-based access control
