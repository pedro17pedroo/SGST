# Stock and Tracking Management System (SGST)

## Overview

SGST (Sistema de Gestão de Stock e Rastreamento) is a world-class inventory management and logistics tracking system specifically designed for Angola's challenging infrastructure conditions. The system provides offline-first operation, computer vision automation, real-time location tracking, and comprehensive logistics management. It's built as a full-stack web application with a modern React frontend and Express.js backend, targeting Portuguese-speaking markets with AOA currency support.

The system handles complete inventory workflows including product registration, stock movements, order management, shipping tracking, automated counting, damage detection, real-time asset tracking, and comprehensive reporting with offline synchronization. It's designed to operate reliably in low-connectivity environments while providing enterprise-grade capabilities for businesses of all sizes in Angola.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client application uses **React 18** with **TypeScript** and **Vite** for development tooling. The UI is built with **shadcn/ui components** and **Radix UI primitives**, providing a consistent design system with **Tailwind CSS** for styling. State management is handled through **TanStack Query** for server state and React hooks for local state.

The application follows a modular page-based routing structure using **Wouter** for client-side navigation. Key architectural decisions include:
- Component composition pattern with reusable UI components
- Hook-based data fetching with React Query for caching and synchronization
- Responsive design targeting both desktop and mobile devices
- Portuguese language support with currency formatting (AOA - Angolan Kwanza)

### Backend Architecture
The server is built with **Express.js** and **TypeScript**, following a modular architecture pattern with 25+ specialized modules. Key components include:
- **Routes layer**: RESTful API endpoints for all business operations
- **Storage layer**: Data access abstraction with comprehensive CRUD operations
- **Database layer**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Module system**: Pluggable architecture with dependency management

The API provides endpoints for:
- Dashboard analytics (stats, top products, recent activities)
- Product management (CRUD operations with search capabilities)
- Inventory tracking (stock levels, movements, alerts)
- Order processing and shipment management
- User management and reporting
- **Offline synchronization** (CRDTs, conflict resolution)
- **Computer vision** (automated counting, damage detection, label reading)
- **Real-time location tracking** (RFID + UWB + BLE hybrid system)
- **Advanced analytics** and predictive insights

### Database Design
Uses **PostgreSQL** as the primary database with **Drizzle ORM** for schema management and queries. The schema includes:
- **Users**: Authentication and role-based access control
- **Products**: Complete product catalog with SKU, pricing, and categorization
- **Inventory**: Multi-warehouse stock tracking with real-time updates
- **Categories & Suppliers**: Product organization and vendor management
- **Orders & Shipments**: Complete order lifecycle from creation to delivery
- **Stock Movements**: Audit trail for all inventory changes

Schema uses UUID primary keys and includes proper foreign key relationships with cascading operations where appropriate.
